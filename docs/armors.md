# ARMORS

In your wandering through the forest, you will most likely be attacked by animals and monsters. For this reason it is important to be protected, and the armor has this purpose.  During the exploration of the forest, you will be able to find armors left by previous characters: however, you can always and only take an armor. **Once taken, you will not be able to change the armor.** So choose it well.

## ARMOR CLASS

Each armor is characterized by a resistance to knocks and attacks, called "armor class" (AC), which is indicated by a number. The higher this number, the greater the protection you will receive.

When you decide to attack a monster, it could hit you, potentially causing you a number of hit points: however, if the suffered hit points are **less** than the armor class, then the hit will be "absorbed" by the armor and **you will not take any damage**.

In a nutshell, this is the list of armors that can be found and the relative resistance score:
