# INSTRUCTIONS

In order to play "minirpg" you need a COMMODORE 64 or an emulator of this computer, because the game does not work on modern computers. The game has been tried and it works correctly with *"VICE - the Versatile Commodore Emulator" ver. 3.2*. You can download it for free by [clicking here](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/).  

Once the emulator software has been installed, follow the instructions below:
 - start **x64.exe** program;
 - click on **File** > **Attach disk image** > **Drive 8**;
 - select <code>minirpg-all.d64</code> file ([click here to download](https://github.com/spotlessmind1975/minirpg/blob/master/miniprg-all.d64));
 - click on **Attach**;
 - type <code>LOAD "MINIRPG",8,1</code>;
 - when finished loading, type <code>RUN</code>.

The first question (<code>TIMELINE#</code>) is used to select which "scenario" you want to play. Any positive decimal number can be entered, and the same scenario can be played for the same number.
